# Bank_Customer_Churn_prediction
In this Notebook we will use the Bank Customer Data to Predict the Churn of a Customer

Customer churn is a financial term that refers to the loss of a client or customerâ€”that is, when a customer ceases to interact with a company or business. Similarly, the churn rate is the rate at which customers or clients are leaving a company within a specific period of time. A churn rate higher than a certain threshold can have both tangible and intangible effects on a company's business success. Ideally, companies like to retain as many customers as they can.

In this Notebook we will explore the Bank Customer churn data provided by Kaggle and perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, Model Building.
At last we will se how to handle a imbalance class and how to evaluate and select the final model.
